Something between a GUI and a CLI way of downloading apps.

## Description

You know how hard it can be to install CLIs/TUIs, you have to:

1. Git clone them
2. Follow the instructions
3. Get an error
4. Search for a solution
5. Follow the instructions again
6. Install it
7. And clean up

7 steps! But what if there was an easier way...

Introducing TUI-SHOP, an app store somewhere between CLIs and GUIs made specifically for CLI/TUI enthusiasts!

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gcat101/tui-shop.git
cd tui-shop
chmod +x ./install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

After that, go into /opt/tui-shop/config.json and paste your github key.

To get a github key you need to:

1. Login into github,

2. Go to account settings;

3. Go to developer settings,

4. Go to keys,

5. Create an infinite key with no permissions:

And that's it! The last time you'll have to install a TUI/CLI manualy (at least i hope so)
